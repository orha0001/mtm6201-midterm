                <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
                <p>"Peddies Produce was founded in 1994 in a rural town outside of Ottawa by Dawson Peddie, a local farmer from Ottawa. Since then, they have expanded to over 4 produce plants and provide fresh fruits and vegetables to a grocery store near you. Over the years, they began to distribute products not only to Ottawa and Ontario but to almost all of Canada. These distributions, which first started in the province of Quebec, were admired over the years and began to spread to other provinces. These products, which were distributed to approximately 25 cities from 7 provinces, added fame to Paddies Produce..."</p>
